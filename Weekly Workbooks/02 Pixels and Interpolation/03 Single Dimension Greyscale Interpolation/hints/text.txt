You might have to think a bit to figure out how to adapt the pixel looping code inside the `draw` function of _RedNoise_ in order to achieve the above gradient. Don't worry about the transparency/alpha channel of the pixels - just set it to 255 (fully opaque) as we did in the original _RedNoise_ template.
