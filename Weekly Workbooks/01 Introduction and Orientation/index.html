<h3 id="task-1-introduction">Task 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The aim of this introductory workbook is to ease you gently into the first week of term. The main objective is to make sure you are able to build and run the code template project. This is of crucial importance because this template is the starting point for <strong>ALL</strong> of the work you will undertake on this unit. Getting the template project working <em>might</em> take some time and perseverance (depending on the operating system you intend to use for this unit). It is <strong>ESSENTIAL</strong> that you achieve everything in this workbook during the first week of term. If you are unable to build and run applications, you will quickly find yourself falling behind on this unit.</p>
<h1 id="section"></h1>
<h3 id="task-2-language-and-libraries">Task 2: Language and Libraries</h3>
<p>The implementation language for this unit will be C++. Everybody will have their own preferred language for writing code, however C++ is still very much the standard for low-level graphics rendering applications. If we didn’t use this as the primary language for this unit, potential employers might think it very unusual.</p>
<p>The aim of this unit is to develop a fundamental understanding of graphics rendering and as such, we will NOT be making use of any existing rendering frameworks (such as OpenGL or DirectX). Instead, we will building our own rending engines ! That said, the practical exercises will make use of the following two external libraries: - <a href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm" target="_blank">GLM</a> for general purpose mathematical operations (mostly for manipulating vectors and matrices) - <a href="https://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">SDL2</a> for drawing to the screen (mostly setting the colour of individual pixels !)</p>
<p>Remember: The aim of this unit is to learn to build things from the ground-up, so don’t use anything other than SDL2 and GLM when implementing the practical exercises (and in the coursework itself).</p>
<p>In order to make things a little tidier, we have provided a “wrapper” object around SDL2 called <code>DrawingWindow</code> . This wrapper initialises SDL, opens up a window for drawing to the screen and provides various methods for drawing and interacting with the user. The <code>DrawingWindow</code> object has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DrawingWindow</code> constructor for the drawing window that takes 3 parameters:
<ul>
<li>Horizontal resolution for the window (integer width)</li>
<li>Vertical resolution for the window (integer height)</li>
<li>Whether or not to show the window in full-screen mode (boolean)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>setPixelColour</code> sets an individual pixel (indicated by x,y coordinates) to a specified ARGB colour</li>
<li><code>getPixelColour</code> returns the colour of the pixel indicated by x and y coordinates</li>
<li><code>renderFrame</code> draws all pixels to the screen (until you call this, all pixel changes are just in a memory buffer)</li>
<li><code>savePPM</code> saves the currently rendered content of the window to a .ppm image file</li>
<li><code>saveBMP</code> saves the currently rendered content of the window to a .bmp image file</li>
<li><code>clearPixels</code> clears all pixel colours (from the whole window)</li>
<li><code>pollForInputEvents</code> checks to see if there are any events waiting to be processed (returns true if there are !)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of how to call the methods of the <code>DrawingWindow</code> class are included in the <a href="extras/RedNoise/src/RedNoise.cpp" target="_blank">template project</a>.</p>

<h3 id="task-3-using-your-own-computer-native-os">Task 3: Using Your Own Computer (Native OS)</h3>
<p>We have tried to use a programming language and set of libraries that are agnostic to the underlying architecture and operating system. As a result, it should be <em>fairly</em> straight-forward to get things running on most machines. Note however that we will test and mark the coursework assignment on the lab machines, so you should avoid using any platform-specific features that aren’t available on the lab machines.</p>
<p>The template project we have provided assumes that you have the <code>clang</code> complier installed (which many of you may already have !). If you do not currently have <code>clang</code>, you can either install it now or alternatively (if you have a different compiler already installed) update the <code>COMPILER</code> variable in the project Makefile to reflect the compiler you have installed (so that it uses <code>g++</code> or <code>cl</code> for example).</p>
<p>You can use an IDE for development if you wish (CLion, Visual Studio, Eclipse, XCode etc). We have provided a CMake file inside the project root folder to help you configure and build your project. If you do use an IDE then please make sure that your project can be compiled outside of the IDE (i.e. by providing a Makefile that works on the lab machines).</p>
<p>Installation of SDL2 can sometimes be non-trivial (due to the fact that it must link with native graphics libraries). For this reason, the recommended way to install it is using a package manager (e.g. apt, rpm, yum, brew, ports, pacman etc). The name of the required SDL2 package will vary depending on your platform. Here are some likely candidates for a range of different package managers:</p>
<pre><code>apt install libsdl2-dev
rpm -i SDL2-devel
yum install SDL2-devel
brew install sdl2
port install libsdl2
pacman -S sdl2</code></pre>
<p>If you can’t get your package manager to install SDL2 (or if you don’t have a package manager at all !) then you will have to install it manually. Various useful resources are available online for achieving this, but you might like to start by taking a look at <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. If you are really struggling to install SDL on your existing operating system, then the following sections provide some alternatives you might like to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
The code template (that we will introduce later in this workbook) comes bundled with the GLM library built-in, so there is no need for you to install this yourselves !</p>
<h1 id="section-2"></h1>
<h3 id="task-4-using-your-own-computer-resident-os">Task 4: Using Your Own Computer (Resident OS)</h3>
<p>If you are having difficulties installing SDL2 on your existing operating system, you might find things easier using a fresh operating system install. We have created a <a href="extras/Vagrantfile" target="_blank">Vagrant configuration file</a> that can be used to bring up a virtual machine with all of the required tools and libraries installed. See the comments at the top of the configuration file for instructions on how to get started with Vagrant.</p>
<p>Alternatively (if you are confident to do so) it might be worth considering a “fresh” install of your preferred linux distribution. It should be relatively straight-forward to install SDL2 on a clean linux install using a decent package manager. You might even like to consider dual booting your computer (if you are brave enough to do so !)</p>
<p>It is possible to build and compile the template project using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Recent versions of Windows <em>should</em> be able to run graphical linux applications seamlessly (i.e. without having to install and configure XWindows/X11). Note that if you have an older version of Windows 10, you might need to do a software update in order to allow graphical applications to work out-of-the-box.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
If using a virtual machine, you should avoid using display scaling (i.e. use VirtualBox in 100% “Unscaled Output” mode) otherwise you may experience a reduction in window manager performance.</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-using-the-lab-machines">Task 5: Using the Lab Machines</h3>
<p>As an alternative to getting SDL2 installed on your own computer, you might choose to compile and run your code on the lab machines in MVB (which have all of the required software installed). The lab machines can either be used physically (whilst you are actually in the lab) or remotely (via remote desktop services). In order to gain remote access you will need to use the <em>X2Go</em> client. Full instructions for installing and running the <em>X2Go</em> client can be found in <a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx" target="_blank">this how-to guide</a>. It is worth noting however that the quality of your experience using this approach will vary depending on the quality of your internet connection.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
For help resolving problems with remote access to the lab machines, check out the <a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/contacts.aspx" target="_blank">IT services help page</a> in particular the rapid response teaching support helpline !</p>
<p>If you get a warning that <code>GLX is not supported</code> when remote logging in to the lab machines using X2Go then you will need to disable hardware acceleration in the template project. Open the <code>libs/sdw/DrawingWindow.cpp</code> file and change the value of the <code>flags</code> variable from <code>SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL</code> so that it now reads <code>SDL_WINDOW_FOREIGN</code>. This will disable hardware acceleration and <em>should</em> solve the problem - it may run more slowly, but at least it will run !</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-the-template-project">Task 6: The Template Project</h3>
<p>In order to help get you started, we have provided a template project called <a href="extras/RedNoise" target="_blank">RedNoise</a>. This project provides the structure that you will need for the weekly workbooks, as well as illustrating the use of the <code>DrawingWindow</code> methods.</p>
<p>In order to help you compile, link and run the <a href="extras/RedNoise" target="_blank">RedNoise</a> project, a Makefile has been provided for you inside the project root folder. This makefile contains multiple rules to build code for different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug</code> a development build rule that will compile and link your project for use with a debugger (gdb)</li>
<li><code>diagnostic</code> a development build rule that includes extra memory checking and diagnosis flags.<br />
Note: this rule requires <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html" target="_blank">Address Sanitizer</a> to be installed (comes built-in with some C++ compilers)</li>
<li><code>speedy</code> a rule that builds an optimised “high performance” executable (making interaction testing quicker)</li>
<li><code>production</code> a build rule to make an executable without debug hooks (for release or distribution)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just typing <code>make</code> on its own will build the project using the <em>debug</em> rule and run the resultant executable.</p>
<p>When you have successfully built and run the <code>RedNoise</code> project you should see a window that looks like the below animation. Remember that the cleanest way to quit an SDL application is by pressing the <code>ESC</code> key ! If you have a window that you can’t close (which does happen from time to time), you may need to kill off the process manually using Task Manager, Activity Monitor or the kill/killall command (depending on your platform).</p>
<p><img src="06%20The%20Template%20Project/images/RedNoise.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
On some platforms you may need to #include <code>&lt;cstring&gt;</code> in the <code>DrawingWindow</code> class (if the compiler complains that it can’t find <code>memset</code>).</p>
<p>On some platforms you might also need to alter the #include statement in the <code>DrawingWindow.h</code> file from <code>"SDL.h"</code> to <code>"SDL2/SDL.h"</code> to allow the compiler to find the SDL library.</p>
<h1 id="section-5"></h1>
<h3 id="task-7-understanding-the-template">Task 7: Understanding the Template</h3>
<p>It is useful to spend a little time getting to know the structure of the <a href="extras/RedNoise/src/RedNoise.cpp" target="_blank">main class</a> in the template project. We are going to be using it a lot over the next few weeks, so it is going to be important. The main function in the template contains a “forever” loop which:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Polls the event queue for incoming mouse and keyboard events</li>
<li>Draws the scene to the screen memory buffer</li>
<li>Renders the memory buffer onto the SDL window</li>
</ol>
<p>Drawing the scene onto the screen buffer basically involves looping through a pixel at a time, deciding what colour it should be, packing that colour into an integer and setting the relevant pixel to that colour. The <code>RedNoise</code> example just creates a random pattern of red pixels of varying brightness. This may seem a bit pointless, but it does allow us to make sure that the code in actually running. In later weeks we are going to do more sophisticated (and more useful) things with the pixels !</p>
<p>You will note from the <code>handleEvent</code> method that it is possible to respond to both mouse and keyboard events. In the <code>RedNoise</code> example, key presses simply print out messages to the terminal (by directing strings to the <code>cout</code> object). In later weeks we are going to use these event handlers to allow the user to navigate around a scene and switch between different rendering modes. For the time being however, just printing out messages is fine.</p>
<p>Clicking the mouse inside the SDL window will cause a screenshot of the current content of the window to be saved to the filesystem. You will notice that both PPM and BMP files are generated. The reason for this is that some platforms and image viewer can be fussy about the format of image files. Pick whichever file format works best on your platform and work with that.</p>
<h1 id="section-6"></h1>
<h3 id="task-8-github-repository">Task 8: GitHub Repository</h3>
<p>The emphasis of this unit is gaining an understanding of Computer Graphics through evolutionary prototyping and iterative experimentation. It is not just about the final product: it is a journey of exploration, where your evolving codebase is your laboratory. So that we may keep an eye on the evolution of your code, it is <strong>ESSENTIAL</strong> that you create a private repository and use GitHub to manage your codebase throughout the unit. This allows us to monitor everyones progress and spot any problems or anomalies as they arise. Whenever you make any changes to your code your should commit and push those changes to GitHub. We strongly advise you to commit changes regularly - after each development session as a minimum (e.g. at the end of an afternoon of coding).</p>
<p>If you are taking the coursework variant of this unit, your repo will eventually become your assessed codebase during the 3 week assignment. It is therefore essential that you set it up now and maintain it throughout the unit. The evolution of your codebase will be used as part of the final coursework marking process. This reflects the fact that the journey is important as the destination !</p>
<p>You won’t need to use all the features of GitHub, just be able to create repositories, make commits and push changes to GitHub. You should avoid using any features which delete, hide or obscure the evolution of your code (such as squashing or rebasing). You should create a suitable <em>private</em> repository and use this to maintain your code. Often the easiest way to set up a repository for a project is to: - create a new repository online (using the GitHub website) - be sure to add a README file on the “New Repository” page - clone the repository to your local computer - add your source code and other resources to the local folder - commit and push all materials back up onto GitHub</p>
<p>In order for us to access your code at any point during the unit, you <strong>MUST</strong> invite GitHub user <code>sl17668</code> as a collaborator to you repository (goto <code>Settings &gt; Collaborators &gt; Add people</code>). We will be using a number of scripts to monitor your progress and to flag anomalies (such as possible plagiarism and/or contract cheating).</p>
<p>Since people often choose to give themselves strange GitHub usernames, you will also need to fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.office.com/r/mydejZ3X9z">this form</a> in order to tell us what your username is (otherwise we won’t know who is who !). This form will also ask you to confirm that you have invited <code>sl17668</code> to your repository.</p>
<h1 id="section-7"></h1>
<h3 id="end-of-workbook">End of workbook</h3>
<p>Make sure you push all your work to your GitHub repository !<br> Use of GitHub is a key development skill.<br> It will allow us to keep track of your progress (and we will use it in the final marking process).</p>
