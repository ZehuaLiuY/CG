The emphasis of this unit is gaining an understanding of Computer Graphics through evolutionary prototyping and iterative experimentation. It is not just about the final product: it is a journey of exploration, where your evolving codebase is your laboratory. So that we may keep an eye on the evolution of your code, it is **ESSENTIAL** that you create a private repository and use GitHub to manage your codebase throughout the unit. This allows us to monitor everyones progress and spot any problems or anomalies as they arise. Whenever you make any changes to your code your should commit and push those changes to GitHub. We strongly advise you to commit changes regularly - after each development session as a minimum (e.g. at the end of an afternoon of coding). 

If you are taking the coursework variant of this unit, your repo will eventually become your assessed codebase during the 3 week assignment. It is therefore essential that you set it up now and maintain it throughout the unit. The evolution of your codebase will be used as part of the final coursework marking process. This reflects the fact that the journey is important as the destination !

You won't need to use all the features of GitHub, just be able to create repositories, make commits and push changes to GitHub. You should avoid using any features which delete, hide or obscure the evolution of your code (such as squashing or rebasing). You should create a suitable _private_ repository and use this to maintain your code. Often the easiest way to set up a repository for a project is to:
- create a new repository online (using the GitHub website)
- be sure to add a README file on the "New Repository" page
- clone the repository to your local computer
- add your source code and other resources to the local folder
- commit and push all materials back up onto GitHub

In order for us to access your code at any point during the unit, you **MUST** invite GitHub user `sl17668` as a collaborator to you repository (goto `Settings > Collaborators > Add people`). We will be using a number of scripts to monitor your progress and to flag anomalies (such as possible plagiarism and/or contract cheating).

Since people often choose to give themselves strange GitHub usernames, you will also need to fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.office.com/r/mydejZ3X9z">this form</a> in order to tell us what your username is (otherwise we won't know who is who !). This form will also ask you to confirm that you have invited `sl17668` to your repository.
